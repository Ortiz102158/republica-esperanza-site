  <h1>Movement for the Salvation of the Republic (MSR)</h1>
  <p><em>“Hope is built by the people, in unity and struggle.”</em></p>

  <h2>⚖️ Human Rights</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Movement for the Salvation of the Republic</strong> grounds its struggle in the universality, indivisibility, and interdependence of human rights. We reaffirm the <em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em> (UN, 1948) as the ethical and legal cornerstone against all forms of oppression.</p>

  <h3>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Excerpt)</h3>
  <p><em>Adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 10, 1948 (Resolution 217 A III)</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Article 1.</strong> All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Article 2.</strong> Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind.</li>
    <li><strong>Article 3.</strong> Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.</li>
    <li><strong>Article 4.</strong> No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.</li>
    <li><strong>Article 5.</strong> No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.</li>

  <h2>🌊 Dominican Diaspora: A Living Force of the Nation</h2>
  <p>Over 2.3 million Dominicans live abroad — mainly in the United States, Spain, and Puerto Rico. Far from representing a “loss”, they constitute a <strong>strategic reserve of talent, solidarity, and resources</strong> that in 2024 contributed USD 10.1 billion in remittances: 12.3% of national GDP (Central Bank of DR).</p>

  <h3>Key contributions to national development:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cultural:</strong> The diaspora sustains merengue, bachata, and critical Caribbean thought on global stages — from New York to Barcelona.</li>
    <li><strong>Political:</strong> From abroad, it denounces corruption, anti-Haitian racism, and the surrender of natural resources — acting as an ethical counterbalance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <strong>MSR</strong> rejects the instrumentalization of remittances to sustain fiscal deficits or external debt. We demand a <em>Sovereign Return Law</em> to transform this force into a driver of: public education, universal health care, food sovereignty, and climate justice.</p>
  <p><em>📌 The diaspora is not peripheral: it is an essential part of the national body.</em></p>    <li><strong>Economic:</strong> Remittances reduce extreme poverty by 32% in recipient households (ENHOGAR 2023). They fund small businesses, housing, and education — yet the State fails to channel them toward productive investment.</li>
    <li><strong>Technological:</strong> Returning youth launch ventures in agroecology, free software, and renewable energy (+48% since 2020).</li>
